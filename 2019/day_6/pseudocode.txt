- Read in the data from the text file
- Store the data into a dictionary with the keys being the body being orbited and the values being the body that's in orbit
- Define find_upwards_path function
    - Try to define the above orbit as the orbit with an index greater than the current index by one
        - Check if the above orbit is the end orbit
        - Else: make a recursive call on the function with current_idx + 1
    - Except if there is an IndexError
        - return None object
    
- Define start orbit
- Define end orbit
- Make a list of the bodies that are being orbited
- Make a list of the bodies that are in orbit
- Infinite Loop
    - Check if the start orbit (variable) is equal to the end orbit or equal to the COM body
    - "Update the current body for each transfer
    - Find the index of the current body in the list of bodies orbiting the keys
    - Check if the current body is in the highest orbit
        - Check if the output from the find_upwards_path function is equal to the end orbit
